# iPhono
=======================

## About
Use the iPhono hardware add-on to turn your iPhone in a record player!
This is the free app that comes along with it. The app allows you to sample audio via the headphone-jack and play it back through the built in (handfree) speakers in a 'press and hold a button to sample, release to playback sample'-fashion.

Tried and tested on iPhone 4s with Jailbroken iOS 7.06, Xcode 5.11
